          At inNuCE Lab, we strive to showcase the potential of neuromorphic
          computing technologies. That's why we've partnered with the
          EBRAINS-Italy projectâ€”to make these solutions easily accessible to all
          developers through our dedicated Heterogeneous Prototyping Platform.
