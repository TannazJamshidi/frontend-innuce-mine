          Neuromorphic computing is a cutting-edge field in computer science and
          engineering inspired by the structure and functionality of the human
          brain. It seeks to design and build systems that mimic the way
          biological neural networks process information, enabling more
          efficient and intelligent computation. This approach often involves
          specialized hardware and algorithms tailored to emulate brain-like
          operations.
